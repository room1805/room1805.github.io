## Introduction 

In recent studies, we found some interesting properties of refusal mechanisms in LLMs. 

1. LLMs tend to refusal more on the complete sentences, while showing jailbreaks on incomplete prompts [room 1805](https://room1805.github.io/room1805/). 
2. Refusal directions are input-specific and there could be several refusal directions for refusal types. [room 1806](https://room1805.github.io/room1806/) 

Accordingly, we are interested in finding **more finite refusal directions** that can explain the refusal mechanisms in LLMs. The finite refusal directions comes from the assumption that

> There exist countable refusal directions that controls the generation of refusal phrases in LLMs.

For this purpose, we propose a novel method to cluster sample-specific refusal directions based on the similarity of the most effective refusal directions.
